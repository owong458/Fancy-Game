Introduction:

This program is basically a shooter game which would hopefully solve two problems:
boredom and lack of knowledge or creativity for game design. 
To elaborate on that, if some random person with free time happens to be bored, 
that person could run this program and the boredom would cease to exist. 
Other people could look at this program for both inspiration and to help understand 
certain concepts crucial for game development that this program relies on.
Primarily, this program is a game. The goal of the game is to destroy as many 
enemies as possible without getting hit by obstacles or enemy bullets. 
The player moves up/down/left/right by using the arrow keys. Ammo is infinite.
Shooting an obstacle causes it to explode.
The player could also die if it is hit by an enemy's bullet. 
The player destroys enemies by hitting them . 
Enemies regenerate over time, with the sole purpose of infuriating the player. 

Instructions:

Run GameWindow.java to open the game. Press S to start immediately, or press i to see the instructions first.
If you press i, the instructions show up. Pressing S while on that screen will start the game.
After starting, select a starting difficulty of 1, 2, or 3.
At any time before or during the game, the L key can be pressed to enable/disable low quality graphics.
The game starts here. Use the arrow keys to move the player. The user has limited Health Points (HP), which are
displayed in the bar at the top left corner. Orange represents how much you have left; black is HP lost. You die
if all your HP is lost. You can lose HP by getting hit by an enemy's bullet, or by colliding with an obstacle.
Your goal is to get as high a score as possible (and as high a difficulty as possible) before you die. You get points
by shooting enemies, obstacles, and for staying alive. The game's difficulty increases throughout the game, meaning 
that there will be more obstacles and enemies the longer you stay alive for. Hitting Boosts and PowerUps can restore HP 
to the player. If you die, press F to restart the game (and pay respects).
